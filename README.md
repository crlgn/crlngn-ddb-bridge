##Carolingian DDB Bridge
This module is a bridge to add features and compatibility to [DDB Gamelog](https://github.com/IamWarHead/ddb-game-log/) byt Warhead. While **Carolingian DDB Bridge module** is free to use, DDB Gamelog has a Free tier and a Pro tier with different features, and this module will only work for Pro tier users. **Warhead** is not responsible for maintaining this module, please don't bother him with requests.

###IMPORTANT:
- The module is **NOT** compatible with Midi-QOL;
